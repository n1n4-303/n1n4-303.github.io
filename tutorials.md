## Understanding granular synthesis with pure data
  
<p>Granulation is a technique in which you manipulate a short-duration microacoustic event (typically between 1 to 100ms) known as grain, that can be used on sound design to achieve multiple results, like creating unpredictability, for instance. It may be useful if you're thinking sound as a process and you can take it to many interesting directions. If you are interested in learning more deeply about granular synthesis and its possibilities, refer to ROADS, 2004.</p>
  
<p>Granular synthesis is behind many fancy plugins or built-in fx you are used to see in your DAW of choice, such as Ableton's Grain Delay. A good way to understand how they're used might be to just try to build a simple granular synthesizer yourself.</p>
